The Younger Generation in the Twenty first Century
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
We always say we are the future. Indeed. We, the younger generation represents modern knowledge, new concepts, ambition and great desire for success. But, have you ever thought of this question: how can we be successful in the century, which is full of great challenges and fierce competitions? In my opinion, there are two important factors.
First, we have to catch the opportunities and face the challenges. China has successfully entered the World Trade Organization, Beijing has won the bid for the 2008 Olympic Games If we want to be successful, we have to seize these opportunities. SARS and AIDS, environmental pollution, growing population We have no choice but to solve these problems with our own hands. Thus, catching the opportunities and trying our best to cope with the difficulties is necessary for us to succeed in the century.
Secondly, we have to learn to cooperate and compete. Last year, when SARS was spreading rapidly in China, scientists all over the world cooperated with each other and prevented the disease from spreading in a short period of time. At the same time, they were also competing against each other to see who could conquer the disease first. By cooperating and competing, the world develops day by day. Therefore, we, the younger generation, must know how to cooperate and compete.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are standing at the outset of a new century, we are at the gate of a new era. Looking back, the century is a century of great developments and remarkable changes. Looking forward, the century is a century full of opportunities, challenges, cooperation and competition. I believe, if we can seize the opportunities, face the challenges, cooperate and compete, success in the century belongs to him, to you and to me.
